them to complete before restarting Jenkins when applying this update.

### 2.17

Release date: 2018-01-22

-   **Major Feature**: Add APIs for FlowNodeStorage to provide more
    granular control of when/how they write to disk 
    ([JENKINS-47172](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-47172))  
    -   Allows for deferred writes, where a FlowNode has all its actions
        attached before being written (cuts writes \~1/2 or more)
    -   Provides facilities a bit like DB transactions
-   **Major Feature**: New and MUCH more efficient pipeline FlowNode
    storage 
    ([JENKINS-47173](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-47173))
    -   Stores all FlowNodes in a single file, allowing for much faster
        bulk streaming read/writes, and faster access.
    -   Available with the performance-optimized durability setting -
        see Jenkins documentation for Pipeline Scalability for what you
        need to enable this.
-   **Enhancement**:  More compact representation of FlowNodes by using
    XStream Aliases
    ([JENKINS-49084](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-49084))
    -   Applies to all of the FlowNode storage engines, and reduces
        size-on-disk (and data written) by about 30%
    -   **Compatibility note: after this change, builds with this plugin
        version CANNOT be read by older versions of this plugin**
-   Feature: utility API to switch between atomic and non-atomic XStream
    serialization
-   Robustness enhancement: Timeout utility tries to repeatedly
    interrupt threads and notes that this is happening
    ([PR\#48](https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-support-plugin/pull/48))
-   Feature: Sandboxed access to upstream build information
    ([JENKINS-31576](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-31576))
-   ClassFilter entries to ensure the XStream/Remoting whitelist doesn't
    break Pipeline
-   Bugfix: Fix a Groovy memory leak introduced previously with the
    Timeout utility: ensure that the timeout threadpool cannot be
    lazy-initialized with a GroovyClassloader as its contextClassloader

### 2.16

Release date: 2017-10-13
